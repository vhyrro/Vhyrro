Yes, it's pronounced Vai-ro, like cairo. I *specifically* made the 'h' silent to invoke such a pronunciation, so don't you dare say it otherwise :p

I enjoy making games, music, models, reverse engineering, NES development etc. - anything that's related to computers and creativity to be honest.
Neovim is my main text editor, yay.

### Projects I Maintain
Whenever I work on a project, I try to give it my all. That's why I make few projects, but make them big projects.
- [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) - A truly modern organizational tool for Neovim. Runs on the `.norg` file format.
- [Super Robin Hood NES Source](https://github.com/vhyrro/SuperRobinHoodNESSource) - the Quattro Adventure: Super Robin Hood source code. Paired with a RAM Map and code explanations. I've currently left this project behind for a while, as I would like to prioritize neorg; but the project isn't abandoned! Work will still be done on it, so fear not :)
