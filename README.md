Yes, it's pronounced Vai-ro, like cairo. I *specifically* made the 'h' silent to provoke such a pronunciation, so don't you dare say it otherwise :P

I'm a guy who just enjoys making software, games, music, models, reverse engineering, NES development etc. - anything that's related to computers and creativity to be honest.

### Projects I Maintain
Whenever I work on a project, I try to give it my all. That's why I make few projects, but make them big projects.
- [Neorg](https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg) - The real competitor to emacs's org mode tailored to neovim. Runs on the .norg file format.
- [Super Robin Hood NES Source](https://github.com/vhyrro/SuperRobinHoodNESSource) - the Quattro Adventure: Super Robin Hood source code. Paired with a RAM Map and code explanations. I've currently left this project behind for a while, as I would like to prioritize neorg; but the project isn't abandoned! Work will still be done on it, so fear not :)

### Projects that I Help in Maintaining
- [Cheovim](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/cheovim) - a config switcher for Neovim written in Lua. Inspired by chemacs.
- [Doom Neovim](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim) - a heavily optimized Neovim configuration for the elites. Get up and running in no time and pay only for what you use. Boasts a ~50ms startup time with all modules enabled.
